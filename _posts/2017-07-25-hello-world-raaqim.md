# Hello World!

Finally got into blogging - Thought it'd be a good idea to get out into the World:

* Going off Calvin's idea [https://calvin.me](https://calvin.me) I got the ['https://raaqim.me'](https://raaqim.me) domain. Thankfully no other Raaqims took it first! If you haven't gotten your own .me I'd get to it - if you have a common name it might be a pretty penny to buy it off someone but you can try other suffixes - be creative!

This blog is about sharing my thoughts, experience and knowledge of Network Security (netsec) and eventually Finance/Investing/Markets. Pretty strange combination but it'll work somehow - I guess this is the motto of anyone in Computing!

This blog is hosted on Github Pages, using Cloudflare to enable SSL via custom domain, using Jekyll with both Project-Pages - [Github for Project-Pages](https://github.com/projectpages/project-pages) and Jekyll-Resume - [Github for Jekyll-Resume](https://github.com/mattcouchman/jekyll-resume) themes combined; Whilst achieving some pretty good scores on GTmetrix - [GTmetrix report](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/raaqim.me/LrpkW2GB)

That's a nice Stack of web technologies if I do say so myself :)
